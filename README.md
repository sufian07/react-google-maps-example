# React Google Maps Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
In this project I tried to find a way where I can get the maps bound and extend it and set it again. For this repo
[React Google Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps).

## Running code
Clone this repo then run `npm install` into the directory and run `npm start`
